Notes,,,,,,,
,"Digikey is my preferred vendor (Good prices, cheapest shipping, ships from Winnipeg) but Mouser and others are good as well.  Same with eBay/Alibaba/Bangood.",,,,,,
,"Most components from eBay could be purchased from Digikey, just an increase in cost (but faster shipping!)",,,,,,
,DO NOT purchase LED’s from eBay/Alibaba.  Testing has shown that LED’s from untrustworthy vendors are a lower quality.,,,,,,
