# ballistic_chronograph_mk2

The Ballistic Chronograph MK2 is based on my earlier model, but has been redesigned for ease of assembly.  For more information, please see td0g.ca.

## Files

### LightGateSensor

The PCB design for the sensors used in the chronograph.

### STL

3D print files for the chronograph.  Make sure to print the correct files as there are options:

* Slit Width: 2mm or 3mm

* Sensor Height: Single or Double

* Sensor Width: 125mm or 100mm

### Arduino Firmware

* BallistiChronographBasic - Very basic use, can support Serial connection or LCD display.

* BallistiChronographCompound - Allows up to 6 sensors, Serial connection only.

* BallisticChronographLCD - Standalone firmware with flash triggering capability for Arduino with an LCD keypad shield.
